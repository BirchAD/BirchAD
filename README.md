## Hello, I'm Andrew and welcome to my profile.

### About Me:

  * After many years working within the immigration "industry", I decided to pursue a career in something I enjoy (programming by the way).

## Projects:

  * Homie: A web app made for mobile browsers allowing those in shared households, with sometimes disorganized shopping
    habits, track essential items.  The project was made in approximately 10 days as a team of 4.  Find the repo [Named Link](https://github.com/Lou951/HOMIE/ "here") and the project's site [Named Link](http://homie.help "here").

  * Islands-R-Us: My first project, created as a team of 4 over 5 days.  An Airbnb clone allowing users to view, create and book islands.
    Find the repo [Named Link](https://github.com/BirchAD/Islands-R-Us/ "here").
